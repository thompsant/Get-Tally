/*
   Get Tally

   Turns on an LED if Program tally for the chosen camera is detected.

   This is written and inteded to be used for the Blackmagic Design 3G-SDI Shield for Arduino.
   This script will read the incoming tally information via the SDI Input on the SDI Shield and
   compare the Tally data array to the set ATEM ID in the script. If the Tally data shows Program
   tally enabled for that ATEM ID, it will turn an LED on that is connected to Digital Pin 8.

   This was created for a dedicated LED box at each camera to provide the URSA Mini 4Ks in our studios
   an "onboard" tally light for use with Autoscript prompter optosensors. Tally Override is not enabled
   so tally will be passed through the shield to the BMD camera.
